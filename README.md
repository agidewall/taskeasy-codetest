My coding test for Task Easy

TODO: 
1. Create Flask server
2. Create file upload
  a. Upload/parse file
  b. Get lat/long info
  c. Save lat/long
3. Create GUI (Map? with lat/long and address fields?)
4. POST?

So, having problems with the API key. Not sure what's werong with it, but the request is definitely working and returning valid data (with an error, but still valid). Not sure what's wrong there...
